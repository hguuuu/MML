neutral
incorrect I cant believe were living here!
anger
correct Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
correct Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don’t want to hurt her.
incorrect I didnt make it!
anger
incorrect You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me!
anger
incorrect Really? Ive been thinking, this is crazy, I mean dont, dont you think we can work on this?

incorrect I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
neutral
incorrect Again. Yknow what? I think we all did.
neutral
correct Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
incorrect What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
neutral
correct Ive just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.

incorrect Every moment is precious.
neutral
incorrect On no! No! Its not good-bye, Im not leaving until you get on that plane.
joy
incorrect Come on Treeger, dont say that.
neutral
incorrect Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway.
neutral
incorrect Youre right! Youre right. Dont say it.
surprise
correct Okay, nows not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
incorrect Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
neutral
incorrect Yknow, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
neutral
incorrect So I dont think I should do it anymore.
neutral
incorrect Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here

surprise
incorrect I mean, no, youre right.
neutral
incorrect But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
anger
correct Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, Im not looking for any thing serious.
incorrect She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
neutral
incorrect She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
neutral
incorrect So, does that mean the audition is off?
neutral
incorrect It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
neutral
incorrect Whats the matter?
neutral
correct I dont know what it is, I just cant take a good picture.

incorrect Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
anger
incorrect Oh, its bad. Its really bad. The only thing in there that isnt burned is an ass. Which I do
neutral
incorrect Well, apparently not, and I cant just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly.
anger
correct Two very good points, look Ive known you both a long time, and Ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together.
incorrect no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better.
neutral
incorrect Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.
joy
incorrect Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her,  burping her, oh try this one!
anger
correct Ah, I fooled around with Joeys sister.  Well, thats not the worst part.
correct Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since.
correct Im sorry your wife is gay. I guess women arent that great either.
incorrect O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
neutral
incorrect Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
neutral
correct Im sorry Chandler, yknow you are such a sweet guy and I, I dont want to hurt you.

anger
incorrect Oh, my Bing-a-ling. Ill wait for you. Do you even know how long youre going to be gone?
neutral
incorrect I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
anger
correct Oh, no-no, yknow I absolutely adore Rachel its just that, well it might be a awkward for you.
incorrect Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
neutral
correct Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know?
incorrect Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monicas and she and Chandler had a big fight and theyre not moving in.
neutral
incorrect Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
anger
correct No. A break from us.
correct Because uhwe-wewe split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
correct Good God Bing Iwell I cant say Im altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.
incorrect Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England.
neutral
incorrect Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
neutral
correct So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

neutral
incorrect Yknow, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I dont think Im handling it all that well.
neutral
correct Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
incorrect Im just saying that yknow, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody andhes gonna have his own life. Right?
neutral
correct I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
incorrect Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont really seem to care too much that youre leaving.
neutral
incorrect : Im sure as hell a dancer, its no use Marge will never go for me.
neutral
incorrect Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, dont worry about it!
anger
incorrect Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!

incorrect Hey dad, what's up?  Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
